        At BOOSTK, we are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information. This
        Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our services.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-foreground font-semibold">1. Information We Collect</h3>
      <p>
        We collect information that you provide directly to us, including name, email address, company name, phone number,
        job title, business address, and any other information you choose to provide during consultations or service
        requests. We also collect information about your use of our services through analytics tools, including website
        usage patterns, page views, and interaction data. Additionally, we may collect information from third-party sources
        such as business directories or publicly available information to enhance our service delivery.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-foreground font-semibold">2. How We Use Your Information</h3>
      <p>
        We use the information we collect to provide, maintain, and improve our services, process your requests, communicate
        with you about your account and services, send you marketing communications (with your consent), respond to your
        inquiries, customize your experience, analyze usage patterns, and develop new service offerings. We also use
        information for security purposes, fraud prevention, and legal compliance.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-foreground font-semibold">3. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
      <p>
        We do not sell your personal information. We may share your information with our service delivery teams in the
        Philippines who assist us in providing services, all of whom are bound by strict confidentiality and non-disclosure
        agreements. We may also share information with trusted service providers who assist in website operations, data
        analytics, or business functions, provided they agree to maintain confidentiality. We may disclose information if
        required by law, legal process, or government request, or to protect our rights, property, or safety, or that of
        our clients.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-foreground font-semibold">4. Data Security Measures</h3>
      <p>
        We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information, including
        encryption of data in transit and at rest, access controls, regular security audits, employee training on data
        protection, and secure data storage systems. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic
        storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. We encourage you to use strong passwords and
        notify us immediately if you suspect any unauthorized access.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-foreground font-semibold">5. Your Privacy Rights</h3>

        portability, the right to withdraw consent, and the right to lodge complaints with data protection authorities. To

      <p>
        We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to provide our services, fulfill the purposes outlined
        in this policy, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. When personal
        information is no longer needed, we will securely delete or anonymize it in accordance with our data retention
        policies and applicable laws.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-foreground font-semibold">7. International Data Transfers</h3>
      <p>
        Your information may be transferred to and processed in the Philippines, where our service delivery teams are
        located. We ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your information during international transfers,
        including standard contractual clauses, adequacy decisions, and other legally recognized transfer mechanisms. By
        using our services, you consent to such transfers.
      </p>
