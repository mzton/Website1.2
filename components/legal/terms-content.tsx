      <p>
        Welcome to BOOSTK. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of our services. Please read
        these Terms carefully before using our services.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-foreground font-semibold">1. Agreement to Terms</h3>
      <p>
        By accessing and using BOOSTK services, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you disagree with any
        part of these terms, you may not access our services. These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between
        you and BOOSTK.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-foreground font-semibold">2. Services Description</h3>
      <p>
        BOOSTK provides dedicated global department services, including but not limited to marketing, sales, strategic
        planning, and cross-cultural communications. Our services are powered by teams based in the Philippines, acting as
        an extension of your company. We offer flexible engagement models to meet your business needs, including
        project-based and ongoing retainer arrangements.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-foreground font-semibold">3. Service Agreement</h3>
      <p>
        All services are provided under a formal service agreement that outlines specific deliverables, timelines,
        milestones, payment terms, and performance metrics. The service agreement supersedes these general terms where
        conflicts exist. Each service agreement will be individually negotiated and may include additional terms specific
        to your engagement.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-foreground font-semibold">4. Payment Terms</h3>
      <p>
        Payment terms will be specified in your service agreement. Generally, we require payment according to the agreed
        schedule, which may include upfront deposits, milestone payments, or monthly retainers. Late payments may result
        in service suspension. All fees are non-refundable except as expressly stated in your service agreement. Additional
        services requested beyond the scope of the original agreement may incur additional fees.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-foreground font-semibold">5. Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure</h3>
      <p>
        BOOSTK maintains strict confidentiality regarding your business information, trade secrets, proprietary data,
        client lists, financial information, and strategic plans. Our team members are bound by comprehensive
        non-disclosure agreements. We will not use your confidential information for any purpose other than providing the
        agreed services, and we will take reasonable measures to protect such information from unauthorized access or
        disclosure.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-foreground font-semibold">6. Intellectual Property Rights</h3>
      <p>
        All work products, deliverables, creative content, and materials created specifically for your company remain your
        intellectual property upon full payment. BOOSTK retains the right to use anonymized, aggregated data and general
        methodologies for improving our services and may showcase work samples in our portfolio (with your prior written
        consent). Any pre-existing BOOSTK intellectual property used in service delivery remains our property.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-foreground font-semibold">7. Limitation of Liability</h3>
      <p>
        BOOSTK's liability is limited to the value of services paid for in the preceding 12 months. We are not liable for
        indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to lost profits,
        revenue, or business opportunities. Our maximum liability shall not exceed the total fees paid by you in the 12
        months preceding the claim.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-foreground font-semibold">8. Service Level and Performance</h3>
      <p>
        We strive to deliver high-quality services that meet or exceed industry standards. However, we do not guarantee
        specific business outcomes, sales results, or performance metrics. Service level expectations will be defined in
        your service agreement. We are committed to continuous improvement and will work collaboratively with you to
        optimize service delivery.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-foreground font-semibold">9. Termination and Cancellation</h3>
      <p>
        Either party may terminate services with appropriate notice as specified in your service agreement, typically 30
        days written notice. Upon termination, all outstanding fees become immediately due. You remain responsible for all
        fees incurred up to the termination date. Early termination may result in early termination fees as specified in
        your service agreement. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate services immediately for non-payment or
        breach of these Terms.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-foreground font-semibold">10. Data Protection and Privacy</h3>
      <p>
        We comply with applicable data protection laws, including GDPR, CCPA, and local Philippine data protection
        regulations (Data Privacy Act of 2012). We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect
        personal data. See our Privacy Policy for detailed information about how we collect, use, and protect your data.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-foreground font-semibold">11. Force Majeure</h3>
      <p>
        Neither party shall be liable for failure to perform obligations due to circumstances beyond reasonable control,
        including natural disasters, pandemics, war, terrorism, government actions, or infrastructure failures. Affected
        parties must notify the other promptly and make reasonable efforts to resume performance.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-foreground font-semibold">12. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h3>
      <p>
        These terms are governed by applicable international and Philippine law. Disputes will be resolved through binding
        arbitration in accordance with international arbitration standards, unless both parties agree to alternative
        resolution methods. The arbitration will be conducted in English, and the arbitrator's decision will be final and
        binding.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-foreground font-semibold">13. Modifications to Terms</h3>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Material changes will be communicated to you via email or
        through our platform. Continued use of our services after changes constitutes acceptance of the modified Terms. If
        you do not agree to the modified Terms, you must discontinue use of our services.
      </p>
